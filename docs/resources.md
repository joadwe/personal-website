## Calculators

!!! tip "Online Tools"
    Interactive calculators and models I've developed for the research community:

* **[Percent solids to particles per mL](https://joadwe.github.io/percent-solids-calculator/)** - Convert percentage solids to particle concentration
* **[Flow cell model](https://joadwe.github.io/flow-cell-collection/)** - Model flow cell collection efficiency
* **[Snells law model](https://joadwe.github.io/snells-law/)** - Calculate light refraction angles

## Getting Started

!!! question "New to EV Research?"
    If you're new to extracellular vesicle research or flow cytometry, I recommend:
    
    1. Start with the **MISEV guidelines** for standardized EV research
    2. Use **FCMPASS** for flow cytometry standardization
    3. Check out the **UVA EV Course** materials for comprehensive training
    4. Join the international working groups (ISAC-ISEV-ISTH) for community support
